# 625-hws

Tasks need to do here: adding the R implementation of the package and compare the R package and the Cpp package.
Writing more vignette.


## tasks

### Required

- [x] The README.md is clearly written and sufficiently introduces the R package.
- [ ] The help pages are clearly written and sufficiently introduce the function(s) in the R package.
- [ ] The examples are clearly written and sufficiently demonstrate the function(s) in the R package, and can run smoothly without error or warning.
- [ ] The R code is clearly written and well organized. The coding style is neat and consistent. The comments are clearly written and helpful.
- [ ] The vignette(s) are clearly written and sufficiently demonstrate the usage of the function(s) in the R package.
- [ ] The comparison(s) against the original R function(s) on simulated or real datasets clearly and sufficiently demonstrate both correctness and efficiency of the function(s) implemented in the R package.
- [ ] Either sample dataset(s) included in the R package or a wide range of simulated data demonstrate the applications of the function(s) implemented in the R packages (e.g., via examples in help pages or in the vignette(s))
- [ ] The amount of R code is non-trivial.

### Additional works

- [ ] C++ code is included via Rcpp and improves the efficiency of the function(s) implemented in the package (e.g., via comparison(s) against the original R functions(s)).
2. Unit testing cases are included in the R package via testthat and tests the function(s) implemented in the R package.
3. Continuous integration is included and integrated on the GitHub project site. All the tests are passed.
4. Code coverage test is included and integrated on the GitHub project site. The coverage is 100\%.
